UofU Week 11 assignment using Beautiful Soup

Most of this assignment was completed with the help of either ChatGPT or BingAI, mainly for the loop or list comprehension logic. <br>
I also got some help on the plots with either of those AIs.  I did take their suggested code and either change the variables around or with the .mean() or other agg functions; I used .agg('mean') instead.
